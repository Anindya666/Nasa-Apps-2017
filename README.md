This is a project that can predict the richter scale value of upcoming earthquake by analyzing the acceleration of primary wave of earthquake (that has high frequency and acceleration but not destructive). It will also alert the people earlier (depends on the place away from the epicenter) before the destructive wave of the earthquake hits their area. The data will also be preserved on server for farther scientific research.
