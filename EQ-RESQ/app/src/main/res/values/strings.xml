    <string name="precautions">(1) Stop driving.
\n*With a firm grip on the steering wheel, gradually reduce your speed, pull over to the left side of the road, and shut off the engine.
\n*Until the tremors subside, calmly assess your surroundings and use your car radio to stay informed.
\n*If you need to take shelter, leave your key in the ignition and the door unlocked.
\n*Taking your vehicle inspection papers and other important belongings with you, head for a shelter on foot.\n\n(2) On the Road
\n*Don’t just stand there. Use a bag or something else to protect your head from falling objects such as glass and building signs, and seek shelter in an open area or park.
\n*Don’t get too close to cinder block walls or vending machines.
\n*Watch out for telephone poles that are about to fall over and dangling power lines.
\n*If there is no open space nearby, calmly assess your surroundings and move somewhere with a high degree of safety, away from buildings.\n\n(3) Near the Shore
\n*If you feel tremors, immediately seek the safety of high ground.
\n*Stay away from the shore until all tsunami alerts and warnings are lifted.\n\n(4) On the Train
\n*Grip the railing or hand strap tightly.
\n*Even if the train stops between stations, do not exit the train on your own through a window or door using the emergency door override.
\n*Calmly follow the instructions given to you by the conductors.\n\n(5)Indoor
\n*Immediately seek a safe location such as in a doorway (if you live in an old, adobe house that is not reinforced), beneath a table or desk, or along an interior wall away from windows or hazardous objects.
\n*Cover the back of your head and your eyes to minimize injury from flying debris.
\n*Do not take elevators during an earthquake.
\n*If cooking, turn off heating elements immediately.
\n*Stay calm and brace yourself to keep your balance, sitting if possible.\n</string>
